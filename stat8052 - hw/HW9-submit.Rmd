model assumptions.

# 1. P12.1

## (a)
For this problem, we have brand which has 4 levels and is fixed. We methods which has 2 levels and also fixed. We also have filters which has 8 levels and is selected at random. There are no nested effect present in this problem, all effects are crossed. Let B denoted to brand, M denoted to methods, and F denoted to filter. 
The Hasse diagram is shown below:

## (b)
For this problem, Let A denote to Lab, and thus A has 6 levels. Let B denote to samples, and thus B has 7 levels. Because each sample will have two measurements, thus we have n=2 replicates. Since we have samples within groups and each group is assigned to a lab, thus we can see that samples are nested in labs. 
The Hasse diagram is shown below:

## (c)
For this problem, similar to (b) above, we have A-lab with 6 levels; B-sample with 7 levels. Now denote C to be the subsamples which is random with 2 levels.

## (b)

For the test, for convenience I only wrote the test part using letters just similar to Lab 5. However, it actually represent MS. For example, A represents $MS_A$ and E represents $MS_E$ etc.

# 4. P12.3 
For this problem, let denote A to be clinic with 4 levels and fixed. Denote B to be doctors with 3 levels and is random. Denote C to b the checkup type with 2 levels and fixed. Denote G to be family group with 2 levels and is random. We also have doctors nested within clinics. Other factors are crossed.  

Thus, the Hasse diagram is shown: 
![](C:/Users/leonz/Desktop/UMN/Spring 2021/STAT 8052/HW/HW9/p123a.jpg){#id .class width=45% height=45%}

# 5. P12.8



For this problem, Denote A to subject which has 10 levels and is random; B to volum which has 2 levels and is fixed; C to days which has 4 levels and fixed and also nested in volumn. 
```{r}
br.df <- read.table("http://www.stat.umn.edu/~gary/book/fcdae.data/pr12.8",header=TRUE)
br.df$day <- as.factor(br.df$day)
br.df$taken <- as.factor(br.df$taken)
br.df$subject <- as.factor(br.df$subject)
```








For this problem, The Hasse diagram, and all the detailed calculation and steps are included in the Appndix. I only used R to obtain estimated values such as for MS, differential effects, and also for numerical calculations. 
Also, for this problem, we can following the steps shown in lecture notes from 12.60-12.62


 





The ANOVA table is below: 
```{r}
options(contrasts = c('contr.sum', 'contr.poly'))
mod <- lm(retained ~ taken*(subject/day), data=br.df)
anova(mod)
```

We can get the the treatment effects from the coefficients: 
```{r}
summary(mod)
```

From the ANOVA output, we can have the following MS:
```{r}
msa <- 0.5704
msb <- 4.1926 
msc <- 0.9513 
msab <- 0.0961 
msac <- 0.3419
```

```{r}
ms <- (1/40)*msa - (3/40)*msac + (1/20)*msab + (1/20)*msc
ms
```

```{r}
numerator <- ms^2
denom <- (1/40)^2 * (msa^2 /9) + (3/40)^2 * (msac^2 / 18) + (1/20)^2 * (msab^2 / 9) + (1/20)^2 * (msc^2 /2)
df1 <- numerator/denom
df1
```


```{r}
t_crit <- qt(0.025, df1, lower.tail=FALSE)
t_crit
```
10 ml 95% CI:
```{r}
upper_10 <- 2.253 + t_crit*sqrt(ms)
lowr_10 <- 2.253 - t_crit*sqrt(ms)


upper_10
lowr_10
```
Thus, for 10 ml, we hav 95% CI (0.92, 3.59)


20 ml 95% CI:
```{r}
upper_20 <- 2.9 + t_crit*sqrt(ms)
lowr_20 <- 2.9 - t_crit*sqrt(ms)


upper_20
lowr_20

```

Thus, for the 20ml, we hav 95% CI (1.56, 4.24)
